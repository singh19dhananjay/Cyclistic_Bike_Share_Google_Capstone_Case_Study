# Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

Top recommendations to convert casual riders to annual members -

**Recommendation 1.** Causal riders usually use bikes on weekends, and majority of them use classic bikes. Cyclistic should offer discounted rides during the weekends and on electric bikes as part of annual membership to increase bike-share among casual riders. 

**Recommendation 2.** Cyclistic could also offer a point system in the annual membership which gives the riders restaurant/cafe coupons if they ride a certain number of miles or if they ride more than a particular duration. Most popular routes taken by casual riders showed that they mostly ride in the downtown area which has a lot of cafes and restaurants. This point system could nudge the casual riders to convert to annual members.

**Recommendation 3.** Advertisement campaigns including coupons or discounts could be designed to promote the use of bikes in the colder months by highlighting the health benefits especially if using classic bikes. This will increase the bike-share in the winter season and might also attract casual riders who tend to use classic bikes more.
